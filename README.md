# SpotSync

SpotSync is a web app hosted on a Flask server

## Installation

Clone the repository

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the flask server:
```python
python3 main.py
```

use the url generated by the Flask output

## Explanation
The server uses knowledge of previously added playlists to determine how related one song is to another
To add more playlists to better improve accuracy, click the "Add Playlists to Databases" button, and input the playlist ID

To get related songs input the fields in the home page
- songs used as a seed are songs that are definitely going in the generated playlist. All other songs are compared to these songs for similarity. This can be a comma separated list of songs
- songs used as a source are all the songs that the database will compare. This is also a comma separated list. If this field is left empty, it will compare the seed songs to all the songs in the database.
- Number of songs determines how many songs the program will generate
